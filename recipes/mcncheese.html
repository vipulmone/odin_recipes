        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
                until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, salt,
                and pepper until smooth, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour milk into butter-flour
                mixture while continuously stirring until mixture is smooth and bubbling,
                about 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese to milk mixture and stir
                until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fold macaroni into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
